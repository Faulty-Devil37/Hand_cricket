üéÆ CLASSIC HAND CRICKET RULES üèè

1. Toss Time:
   - You and the computer each pick a number between 1 and 6.
   - Sum of both numbers decides the toss:
       - If the total is EVEN and you chose "even" ‚Üí you win.
       - If the total is ODD and you chose "odd" ‚Üí you win.
       - Else ‚Üí computer wins.

2. The Innings:
   - The batting side picks a number (1 to 6).
   - The bowling side (computer/you) also picks a number (1 to 6).
   - If both numbers match ‚Üí the batsman is OUT!
   - If not ‚Üí the batsman scores runs equal to the number they chose.

3. Each side gets up to 6 balls unless they get out early.

4. Second innings:
   - The other player bats and chases the target.
   - If they reach or beat the target within 6 balls ‚Üí they win.
   - If they get out or fall short ‚Üí they lose.

5. Invalid Inputs:
   - Only numbers 1 to 6 are allowed.
   - Any other input = DISQUALIFIED (aka "HANG IN THE FAN üò§")

Have fun! May your numbers never match üôè‚ú®
